Data-Structures-Learning-Tool		
=============================		
		
This is a program written in Java for teaching about binary trees.		
		
It visually teaches about regular Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and Binary Heaps.

Instructions:
-------------
- Open Data_Structure_Visualizations and run
- Select the type of data structure you want to learn about(BST, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, or Minimum Binary Heap)
- A new window will open.  Select "insert" or "delete", enter a number (maximum of 4 digits), and press "Go!".
- Do this up to 31 times, and watch it build your tree. (Max of 5 Levels)

For BST, AVL:
Insert and delete any <=4 digit integer.

For RedBlack:
Insert and <=4 digit integer. Delete not implemented.

For MinHeap:
Insert any <=4 digit integer. Delete will preform deleteMin on the heap no matter the argument passed.
